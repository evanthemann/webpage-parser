Webpage parser

This is a program to input a url and output the title, meta description, and featured image. Then, it adds those element to a local html file and opens it. 

Why?

This program makes it easy to copy and paste these elements to another program. The image that it finds in this script is a CSS background image that is not easily downloadable on the web page.
